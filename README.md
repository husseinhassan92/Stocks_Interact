## The story 
When I started learning about data science, I was enthusiast about market. Every time I tried to learn more, the market seemed way too complex for me to grasp.
What I found was pretty remarkable. There are statistically relevant and actionable data that have a strong correlation with future price-actions with far superior efficacy than techniques like chart patterns, running averages, and, well, most standard tools available.
Now that I have found the data and tools, I want to share them with you so you do not have to go through all of the same effort and troubles that I did in finding valid stock market data. That way, you can focus on what matters: learning about the market in clear and actionable ways.
